# Assignment 07: The Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon

This project implements a graph-based simulation of the “Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon” problem using both an adjacency list and adjacency matrix. It includes functionality to detect simple cycles and find a connection path from any node to Kevin Bacon.

## Features

- `Graph` interface with two implementations:
  - `AdjacencyListGraph`
  - `AdjacencyMatrixGraph`
- `isSimpleCycle()` function: checks if a given path is a simple cycle
- `findKevinBaconPath()` function: uses BFS to find the shortest connection path to Kevin Bacon
- Graph with 20 people (nodes) and realistic social connections
- Output includes Kevin Bacon number and cycle validation
